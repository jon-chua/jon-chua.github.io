##### $aveNUS allows NUS students to track their food expenses and savings, get food recommendations and more!

Developed as a team project in the module CS2103T (Software Engineering) from September - November 2019.

### Implemented Features:

I implemented a recommendation system that allows users to get a list of recommended food items based on factors such as their likes/dislikes, purchase history and specified budget.
